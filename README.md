# My Professional Portfolio

My portfolio is a page to introduce myself and my work to potential employers and customers.

[Portfolio Page](https://raleighc.github.io/portfolio_02_redux/)


## Usage
This website consists of three pages:
* [About Me](https://raleighc.github.io/portfolio_02_redux/index.html)
* [Portfolio](https://raleighc.github.io/portfolio_02_redux/portfolio.html)
* [Contact](https://raleighc.github.io/portfolio_02_redux/contact.html)

It presents my work and personal information as well as gives potential clients links to my social media and a way to contact me. It is coded in a responsive format ready for use on mobile and PC.
Through a series of links in the navbar
potential customers can learn about my and my work and visit my linkedin and guthub pages for further professional information.

## Creating This Page

It is interesting to look back on the past two months and see how far I have come. Being able to change my portfolio out from old artwork to completed coding projects I am proud of felt good. This struggles with updating this portfolio were mostly in fine tuning the styling away from looking like a bootstrap page on first look. The next step I want to take is adding in javascript to dynamically populate the portfolio and give it more animation.
